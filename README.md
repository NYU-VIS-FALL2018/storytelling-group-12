## About
In this project our main goal is to find restaurants in different boroughs depending on the different cuisines available and to perform analysis based on the inspection data collected. It also helps us filter out restaurants depending on their scores that are determined through the inspections. It provides us helpful insights regarding the violations the restaurants have made and determine how hygienic a place is.
